# Greenword General Hospital

Hospital, an institution that is built, staffed, and equipped for the diagnosis of disease; for the treatment, both medical and surgical, of the sick and the injured; 
and for their housing during this process. The modern hospital also often serves as a centre for investigation and for teaching. To better serve the wide-ranging 
needs of the community, the modern hospital has often developed outpatient facilities, as well as emergency, psychiatric, and rehabilitation services. In addition, 
“bedless hospitals” provide strictly ambulatory (outpatient) care and day surgery. Patients arrive at the facility for short appointments. They may also stay for 
treatment in surgical or medical units for part of a day or for a full day, after which they are discharged for follow-up by a primary care health provider. Vs

### History of hospitals :

As early as 4000 BCE, religions identified certain of their deities with healing. The temples of Saturn, and later of Asclepius in Asia Minor, were recognized as 
healing centres. Brahmanic hospitals were established in Sri Lanka as early as 431 BCE, and King Ashoka established a chain of hospitals in Hindustan about 230 BCE. 
Around 100 BCE the Romans established hospitals (valetudinaria) for the treatment of their sick and injured soldiers; their care was important because it was upon 
the integrity of the legions that the power of ancient Rome was based. Ruins of the sanctuary of Asclepius at Cos, Greece Ruins of the sanctuary of Asclepius at Cos,

having been converted to Christianity, abolished all pagan hospitals and thus created the opportunity for a new start. Until that time disease had isolated the 
sufferer from the community. 

### Ownership and control

The issues of hospital ownership and control underwent significant analysis and change in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Such transformation was prevalent 
in developed countries, particularly those in which fiscal sustainability was problematic.In many countries nearly all hospitals are owned and operated by the 
government. In Great Britain, except for a small number run by religious orders or serving special groups, most hospitals are within the National Health Service. 
The local hospital management committee answers directly to the regional hospital board and ultimately to the Department of Health and Social Security. In the 
United States most hospitals are neither owned nor operated by governmental agencies. In some instances hospitals that are part of a regional health authority 
are governed by the board of the regional authority, and hence these hospitals no longer have their own boards.


### Financing

Financing
Because hospitals may serve specific populations and because they may be not-for-profit or for-profit, there exist a variety of mechanisms for hospital financing. 
Almost universally, hospital-construction costs are met at least in some part by governmental contributions. Operating costs, however, are taken care of in 
different ways. For example, funds may come from private endowments or gifts, general funds of some unit of government, funds collected by insurance carriers 
from subscribers, or some combination thereof. In some countries, operating costs may be supplemented in part by public
